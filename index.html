  <p>Hello, I'm Aisaiah Pellecer! I am an Information Sciences and Data Science dual-degree (B.S) student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am really interested in data science and opportunties within the field. From my experiences I understand how important Data Science is to our society and I am eager to learn more!</p>
  <p>This is a quick site I made to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Science and other related topics.</p>

    <b>Description:</b> In an effort to add more to my Github portfolio I have decided to redo a past STATA project using Python. The Project was Sample Survey Data Analysis. I had completed the project for my Introduction to Econometrics Course at Bard College. Although, I appreciate that I was able to code in STATA, I believe that it would be much more beneficial for me to conduct this type analysis on Python; for my own personal growth and because softwares like Python and R are commonly used in the Data Analytics industry.

    <b>Skills:</b> data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, data visualization.
