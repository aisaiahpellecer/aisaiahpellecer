    <p>Hello, I'm Aisaiah Pellecer! I am an Information Sciences and Data Science dual-degree (B.S) student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am really interested in data science and opportunties within the field. From my experiences I understand how important Data Science is to our society and I am eager to learn more!</p>
    <p>This is a quick site I made to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Science and other related topics.</p>

        <p><b> Description: </b> In an effort to add more to my Github portfolio I have decided to redo a past STATA project using Python. The Project was Sample Survey Data Analysis. I had completed the project for my Introduction to Econometrics Course at Bard College. Although, I appreciate that I was able to code in STATA, I believe that it would be much more beneficial for me to conduct this type analysis on Python; for my own personal growth and because softwares like Python and R are commonly used in the Data Analytics industry.

        <p><b> Description: </b> It was a pleasure to continue this work, this past summer, as a City of Chicago STEAMbassador and Data Coordinator for MAPSCorps, a non-profit organization focused on data-driven community advocacy. As part of my internship, I was able to work with community-based organizations on the Southside of Chicago, educate youth on data literacy and data analytics, and guide the development of a research project on the relationship between asset-conditions in the South Shore community area and gun-violence. Due to the quality of our project, my team was awarded with the MAPSCorps Data-Driven Community Advocacy award, a $10,000 Group Scholarship.

          <li>MAPSCorps produces an annual census of high quality data about all the businesses and organizations in a community. These data are used by healthcare professionals, policymakers, researchers, leaders, entrepreneurs, residents and others for better health, well-being and economic vitality.</li>
        </ul>
        Here's an opportunity to look at the work produced by my team and youth of the South Shore Site!</p>

        <p><b> Description: </b> For this project want to explore the characteristics of various healthcare systems across the nations and understand the potential factors that influence healthcare system performances. By understanding how the quality of the healthcare systems varies under different settings, we can provide solutions to improve the healthcare systems. The dataset used for this research is the Compendium of the U.S. Health Systems (2021 updated). It is provided by the CHSP Initiative and has 637 healthcare systems across the nation. The dataset includes useful variables for analysis such as total counts of physicians, primary care physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and many more.
